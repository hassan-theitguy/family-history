Hi. My name is Hassan Voyeau. Son of Ann Marie Khan and Marcel Voyeau. Brother of Sabrina Khan and Christopher Voyeau (step brother). This is my attempt to chronicle some history and family tree on both my paternal and maternal sides. If you come across this then feel free to tell me how we are related and what you have to add. I will revise and update github as I get more to add. Most of this is coming from my mother so far. Mistakes are bound to happen but we try to be as accurate as possible and make revisions when needed tracked through github.

Noor Hassan (Hassan Khan) - my great great grand father - He was a founding member of ASJA. He was a scholar in urdu. He had a [son] who became homeless (possibly named Usman and on the streets of Mucurapo) after losing all his posessions to his wife. (Umraw/Jagru/son or brother/any brothers?) Khan living in Barataria was one of his sons. Yacoob Khan was another son. Yacoob daughter is named Polly and is living in Barrackpore. Another daughter of Yacoob is named Darling. Another daughter of Yacoob (whose mother was Chinese) is living in Maraval and was recently in the hospital. These would be my maternal grandmothers cousins. Another daughter died and she had a special child who also died. My mom went home there once in (possible) Rousillac. Assiran (Assirwa) was Noor Hassan daughter. Three sets of chidren with three wives (possible sisters).

Rafina Hosein is possibly Assirwa great grand daughter. Assirwa daughter is Jasiman. Jasiman son in Rafina father. Assiran husband name is Babu Hosein. Rafina father is Rafeek who was the traffic controller in PTSC.

Jahanghir Khan (Noor Hassan son) - my great grand father (Fyza father). Mother died in childbirth.

Zainool Khan - my grand father - 

Fyza Khan - my grand mother - SM Jaleel wanted his son to marry Fyza but her father said they were too aristocrat.

Shortish curly hair lady. Right name was Hardaya. Visited my mom and my moms siblings in Caroni. She was one of Noor Hassan caretakers. She was fond of my grandmother). One son played the harmonium.
